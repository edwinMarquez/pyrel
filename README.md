# pyrel  @EdwinMrqz
a python karel like program

this is a karel like program,
the goal is to implement a complete language but it is still missing some parts
so far there is a basic interpreter and parser 
-------
Instructions
first start play.py
on unix-likes systems: *python play.py [file with instructions]*
![Pyrel start](/screenshots/pyrel_0.png)
if you specify a file with instructions they're gonna be loaded in the text area
rigth now there are only few instructions:
	-*move*
	-*lookUp*
	-*turnRight*
	-*lookDown*

after you have the program you can start it and wait for it to execute
