# pyrel  @EdwinMrqz
a python karel like program

this is a karel like program,
the goal is to implement a complete language but it is still missing some parts, so far there is a basic interpreter and parser 

-------
<h4> Instructions: </h4>
First start play.py
on unix-like systems: *python play.py [file with instructions]*
![Pyrel start](/screenshots/pyrel_0.png)
if you specify a file with instructions they are going to be loaded in the text area
rigth now there are only few instructions:<br>
	 1. *move*<br>
	 2. *lookUp* <br>
	 3. *turnRight*<br>
	 4. *lookDown*<br>
	 5. *putItem*<br>
	 6. *pickItem*<br>

After you have wrote your program you can start it and wait for it to execute
